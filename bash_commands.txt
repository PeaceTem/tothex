Everything is a file in linux
every file has a number called FD(file descriptor)
Three files are always open whenever a program is executing in linux, the standard input(stdin, FD0),
    the standard output(stdout, FD1), and the standard error(stderr, FD2)

--- redirecting error messages to a file
telnet localhost 2> errorfile, redirect all the error messages to errorfile to prevent cluttering,
    the 2 stands for the (FD2) file descriptor

find . -name 'my*', searches the current directory for a file name that start with 'my'
find . -name 'my*' 2> error.log,  redirecting the error messasges to error.log file
2>&1 , writes the output from one file to the input of another file
* error output is redirected to standartd output whichh in turn is being re-directed to file dirlist
ls Documents ABC > dirlist 2>&1
both the error and the output will be sent to dirlist
