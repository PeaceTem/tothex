<h3>The Beginning</h3>

        <h3>How I started writing the code for this app</h3>
        <p>
            I have always wanted to create something that will be of good use to 
            everyone since I was young. Fortunately, I stumbled upon an idea in 2018
            to create a robot, or simply put, an AI, that will help people through their
            academical journey which will be deployed via a mobile app. It was just an idea, nothing more, nothing less.
            But I didn't know where to start. After rambling for a long time, I later decided to 
            learn <b>Wordpress</b>(it helps one to create a website with no code at all).
            After playing with wordpress for a while, I realised that its power is limited,
            so I went on to learn <b>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</b>. Then, I switched to 
            <b>python</b> in 2020.

        <h3>The most important part of this page.</h3>
        <p>
            I taught for a while. During that period I realised that most, if not all,
             of my students used to forget whatever they were being taught in less than 2 weeks.
             So, I carried out a research to know why people forget things easily(I was
              just browsing the internet though!). Out of all the results I saw online 
            the one that interests me the most is Input-Output-Output-Output model. 
            This model states that the output(revision, practice, rehearsal, or whatever) should
             be at least 3X more than the Input. That was why I decided to build this app.
             So people will be able to practice whatever they've learnt.

        <h3>How I got the name - NeuGott</h3>
        <p>
            NeuGott literally means 'New God' in german(deutsch).
            I got this name from the inventors of calculus - Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz.
            New and Gott makes NewGott. But I didn't like that 'w', so I changed it to 'u', just
             to fit its german version. That was I got <b>NeuGott.</b>

        <h3>My Vision For This App</h3>
        <p>
            To be honest, I'm not even certain about the future of this app for now.
            But imagine this app has over 100 million questions from wide variety of topics. I don't even know what 
            to say.

        <h3>Mein Kampf - My Struggle </h3>
        <p>
            Don't care about what I'm passing through. Just continue learning.
            You will, one day, reap whatever you sow.
